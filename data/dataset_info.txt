   - Range: 1 to 36 (representing different Indian states)
   - Example: 1 = Delhi, 2 = Maharashtra, 3 = Karnataka, etc.
   - Used to detect unusual location patterns

8. zip_code (Integer)
   - First 3 digits of zip code (for privacy)
   - Range: 100 to 999
   - Example: 110, 400, 560
   - Helps in location-based fraud detection

9. category (Integer)
   - Type of transaction
   - Range: 1 to 10
   - Mapping:
     1 = Grocery
     2 = Food & Dining
     3 = Shopping
     4 = Travel

10. upi_id_hash (Integer)
    - Hashed representation of UPI ID (for privacy)
    - Range: 1000 to 99999
    - Example: 12345, 67890
    - Helps detect patterns in UPI ID usage

11. fraud (Integer)
    - Target variable / Label
    - 0 = Legitimate transaction
    - 1 = Fraudulent transaction
    - This is what the model predicts

DATASET STATISTICS:
===================
- Total Transactions: 50,000
- Legitimate (fraud=0): 45,000 (90%)
- Fraudulent (fraud=1): 5,000 (10%)
- This represents realistic fraud ratio in UPI transactions

FEATURE ENGINEERING NOTES:
==========================
- Time features (hour, minute) help detect unusual transaction times
- Location features (state, zip) help detect geolocation anomalies
- Age features help detect account age patterns
- Amount helps detect unusual transaction sizes
- Category helps detect spending pattern anomalies
- Combined features create a comprehensive fraud detection profile
